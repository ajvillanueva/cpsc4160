Project no: Final

Project due date: April 19, 2017

Project description: Fight off evil forces from invading your home planet with your own ship! Use your ship to destroy the enemy and make it to the boss to defeat him and make sure the enemy force never comes back.

The easiest part of this project: Changing the game from horizontal scrolling to vertical scrolling.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Getting the player to work for a single sprite.
